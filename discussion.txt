1)School, City, Country:
How are these data to be filled ? Using some API ? 
In any case one can't expect every user's school, city to be stored in db. 
Like my current city, is Lucknow and I went to Boy's High School. 
So a user should have the option of adding these information even if not already
stored in db.

Post:
A user needs to add tags for the posts(ManyToMany fields can't be empty).
Any other tags required?
